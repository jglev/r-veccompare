## Rebusmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the DESCRIPTION to replace the redundant "The veccompare package contains functions for automating" with "Automates..."

* Single quoted software names such as 'RMarkdown' and 'RStudio'.

* Edited the LICENSE file to contain the third template field (ORGANIZATION). 
  Since there is no organization sponsoring the package, I set the ORGANIZATION field to "copyright holder" so that the CRAN template for the license will read "Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors..."

## Test environments

* local ubuntu 17.04 install, R 3.3.2 (2016-10-31)
* Windows via win-builder, R Under development (unstable) (2017-08-25 r73125)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There were no NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies of this package.
