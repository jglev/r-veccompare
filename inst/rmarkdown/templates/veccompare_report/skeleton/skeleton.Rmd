**Note that `results = "asis"` is set in the code chunks below. This is necessary for output that is printed with the `cat_immediately = TRUE` option (or that is printed with `cat(...)` generally).**

veccompare::compare.vectors.and.return.text.analysis.of.overlap(
	vectors_to_use,
	degrees_of_comparison_to_include = c(1),

# 2-Way Comparisons Graphical and Tabular Summaries

The two-way comparisons can be summerized visually and tabularly in several ways.

First, we present a matrix showing decimal percentage overlap (i.e., "0.23" means "23%") between each pair of maps. This table is intended to be read with row names first, in this form:} *"[row title] overlaps with \[column title] \[cell value] percent."*

```{r print_matrix_summary_of_two_way_comparisons, results = "asis"}
veccompare::summarize.two.way.comparisons.percentage.overlap(
	vectors_to_use,
	output_type = "matrix_plot"
)
```

The table above can also be read in the form below (reading across each row: *[column one] overlaps with [column two] [column three] percent.* As above, we present decimal percentages (i.e., "0.23" means "23%"):

```{r print_melted_table_summary_of_two_way_comparisons, results = "asis"}
pander::pandoc.table(
	veccompare::summarize.two.way.comparisons.percentage.overlap(
		vectors_to_use,
		output_type = "table",
		melt_table = TRUE
	),
	split.cells = 15,
	split.tables = Inf,
	justify = c('center'),
	style = 'multiline'
)
```

Finally, we can create a network graph of all two-way comparisons between maps. Higher overlap is represented with darker lines. Maps are sized based on their relative numbers of items. Relationship lines are directed -- the arrow flows in the direction of overlap (*"[map one] --> overlaps [line label] percent with --> [map two]"*).

This graph only shows relationships at or above 20% overlap.

```{r print_network_graph_summary_of_two_way_comparisons, results = "asis", fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
veccompare::summarize.two.way.comparisons.percentage.overlap(
	vectors_to_use,
	output_type = "network_graph",
	network_graph_minimum = .2
)
```

```{r print_report_on_comparisons, results = "asis", fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}

# We can now get all comparisons between the vectors, from 2-way up to 6-way:

veccompare::compare.vectors.and.return.text.analysis.of.overlap(
	vectors_to_use,
	degrees_of_comparison_to_include = 2:length(vectors_to_use),
	cat_immediately = TRUE,
	draw_venn_diagrams = TRUE,
	viewport_npc_width_height_for_images = 0.65, # If venn diagrams are getting cut off, this number can be lowered (for example, to 0.7)
	base_heading_level_to_use = 1
)
```
